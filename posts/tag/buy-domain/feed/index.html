<h3><strong>How I Go About Ranking These Top Domain Name Registrars</strong></h3>
<p>There’s a number of criteria I go by in order to rank the best domain name registrars on the market. Like I’ve said earlier in this guide, I have used and still use all of these domain registrars, so personal experience goes a long way with my rankings.</p>
<p>That being said, I also consider the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of which to search for domain names</li>
<li>Simple, no-hassle checkout process</li>
<li>Easy configuration</li>
<li>Intuitive dashboard for users to manage their domains</li>
<li>User-friendly DNS settings</li>
<li>Excellent customer service on both live support, knowledge center, and phone.</li>
<li>Number of upsells in the buying process</li>
<li>Long history and a good reputation</li>

<h2><strong>Best Domain Registrar </strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1) <a title="NameCheap Best Domain Registrar" href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a></strong></h3>
<p><a title="Namecheap " href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap.com</a> is one of the most popular domain registrars to buy a cheap domain name. With .com domain name for only $10 per year and .net &amp; .org for $11-$12 per year.</p>
<p>They are a decently cheap priced domain registrar. But the only additional fee that they add to their service is an additional 18¢ for <strong>ICANN registration/year</strong>.</p>
<p><a title="Namecheap" href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> is famous for their Twitter and Facebook contest, where they offer domain names for the lowest price for a particular time. I would recommend buying a domain name from Namecheap.com.</p>
<h3><strong>2)</strong><a title="GoDaddy" href="https://www.godaddy.com/domains" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong> GoDaddy</strong></a></h3>
<p>Godaddy is one of the best domain registrars that costs $10 for the first year and $15 for every year after that; that’s a lot of additional hidden prices.</p>
<p>They are still arguably the leaders of domain name registrars. So there’s no reason you shouldn’t be checking out what they have to offer.</p>
<h3>3) <strong><a title="Domain.com" href="https://www.domain.com/" rel="nofollow">Domain.com</a></strong></h3>
<p>With .com domain names starting from $10 per year, Domain.com is the decent domain name registration service. They are one of the popular choices for domain registration. .net and .org priced at $8.99/year.</p>
<p>So, Domain.com is one of the best value for money domain registrars. Domain.com has a lot to offer given its low price.</p>
<p>So choose anyone though I would recommend buying a domain name from Namecheap.com. But you could try others also.</p>
<h3><strong><a href="https://www.hover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4. Hover</a></strong></h3>
<p>Hover officially launched in 2009, but it’s an offshoot of Tucows Inc., which is the third-largest ICANN accredited registrar online. Hover is essentially a merger of three big players in the domain registrar space.</p>
<p>Hover is great in that they’re incredibly straightforward. They offer domain registering and that’s it. For that reason, it’s very easy to register a domain with them, because that’s all they do. You won’t be bombarded with endless upsells and advertisements for other services of theirs.</p>
<p>The process of setting up your domain names is also quite seamless and their backend is quite nice to use.</p>
<p>Since they just focus their service around this one thing there support is also excellent, and you’ll always have a real person handling your request.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/">5. <strong>Dreamhost</strong></a></h2>
<p>Dreamhost was founded way back in 1997. Today they’re a full-fledged hosting provider and domain name registrar. They now host over 1.5 million websites and have over 400,000 customers. If you’re looking for a domain name registrar that also offers hosting, then Dreamhost might be a good choice for you.</p>
<p>Dreamhost has a host of cool features, like, having a nearly unlimited supply of domain name extensions, offering free domain privacy, easy control over your domain’s settings, and as a plus they’re an environmentally friendly company.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they don’t offer a discount if you already have a domain name and you’re looking to transfer it over to them. They also have a very solid refund policy, but sadly it only transfers over to their shared hosting plans.</p>
<p>Dreamhost costs <strong>$13.95 per year to register a .com</strong> domain name, with the pricing of other domain name extensions being much lower.</p>
