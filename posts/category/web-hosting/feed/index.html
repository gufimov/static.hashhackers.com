										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Dedicated hosting is a hosting configuration in which a server is devoted to a single organization or for a single purpose, such as a website. This is in contrast to shared hosting, in which a server acts as a host to multiple clients. A dedicated hosting service is sometimes referred to as a dedicated server and can be set up in-house or externally as a service from within a data center. Let’s have a look at some of the benefits.</div>
<div></div>
<h3><strong>Customization:</strong></h3>
<div>Dedicated hosting grants a certain freedom and control that other hosting solutions are unable to provide. The fact that the server is dedicated to one client and there are no cohabitants means that the server (and overall hosting solution) can be tailored to the specific needs of that client. This ensures that they can select and pay for the features that they require.</div>
<div></div>
<h3><strong>Uptime:</strong></h3>
<div> In a world where convenience is everything and consumers aren’t used to waiting, it is vital to ensure that a website, for example, is functional at all times; site downtime could lead to customers moving on to competitors. Dedicated hosting allows for high performance and stability to ensure that websites and other business functions are operational virtually 100% of the time (usually upwards of 99.4%). To this end, providers should offer server monitoring and back-up facilities alongside support services (described below) to keep functions running as seamlessly as possible.</div>
<h3><strong>Congestion:</strong></h3>
<div> Server congestion is much less of an issue with a dedicated server, especially when compared to shared hosting options. With the latter, you often run the risk of congestion due to the traffic and usage levels of other websites or applications hosted on the same server, competing for bandwidth, disk space and CPU usage. The very nature of dedicated hosting ensures that this isn’t an issue. It also works the other way; if the website in question is resource heavy then dedicated hosting may be the answer to ensure that other websites aren’t disrupted.</div>
<div></div>
<h3><strong>Security:</strong></h3>
<div>Clients using a dedicated platform will be able to deploy security measures, such as anti-virus and firewall configurations, that are more tailored to their own functions; whilst also avoiding the security vulnerabilities that can otherwise be introduced by the activities of neighboring clients on shared hosting platforms. In addition, dedicated servers located within data centers can benefit from the physical security measures that such facilities often put in place, including, for example, biometric authentication, security guards, and mantraps.</div>
<div></div>
<h3><strong>Support:</strong></h3>
<div>Some dedicated hosting services come with a certain level of support. This is important as a high percentage of dedicated hosting customers use the service to host mission-critical or important computing functions or websites. Effective support ensures that site disruption is kept to a minimum. A fully managed hosting provider, for example, may offer support 24 hours per day, 365 days a year.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Details of support levels, as well as information regarding reliability statistics can usually be found in the service level agreement (SLA). These documents can often provide an insight into the quality of a particular service and should be consulted carefully when going through the process of choosing a provider.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If opting for a dedicated service that does not come with any support, it is important to ensure the presence of the necessary knowledge to manage and maintain a server effectively.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>DomainKeys Identified Mail</em> (<em>DKIM</em>) is an email authentication method designed to detect forged sender addresses in emails (email spoofing), a technique often used in phishing and email spam.</p>
<h2>What is DKIM?</h2>
<p>Its Email Authentication and the record proves that it was sent from the domain it is being shown. This uses Cryptographic Key to sign the emails.</p>
<h2>Why DKIM?</h2>
<p>In simple words, DKIM is necessary so that your messages doesn&#8217;t end up in user spam box, like why Google, Facebook messages never goes into spam and unless we send them ourselves, as they are verified and authenticated that Google or Facebook sent them.</p>
<h2>Setup DKIM Records</h2>
<p>You cannot setup DKIM Record own your own without any help because DKIM is key based and the key must be present on Outgoing Mail Server to match to your domain. GSuite has Authentication Tab in GMAIL Settings for DKIM Signing.</p>
<p>To setup a DKIM you must contact your Email Provider as many services like Godaddy Shared Hosting doesn&#8217;t even supports it. However it doesn&#8217;t means you messages will end up in spam because we can setup DMARC policy and which will help avoid spams.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="huLUZXnqZB"><p><a href="https://static.hashhackers.com/posts/knowing-dmarc-records-and-setting-them-up-correctly/">Knowing DMARC Records and Setting Them Up Correctly</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe title="&#8220;Knowing DMARC Records and Setting Them Up Correctly&#8221; &#8212; Hash Hackers" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" src="https://static.hashhackers.com/posts/knowing-dmarc-records-and-setting-them-up-correctly/embed/#?secret=huLUZXnqZB" data-secret="huLUZXnqZB" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>For every sub-domain or domain a separate DKIM key is required and also a seperate DKIM Record. When you setup emails with clients like Amazon SES and SendGrid they provide you these CNAME Records or DKIM Records to setup DKIM. CNAME records can be used to point a domain to another domain or sub-domain where your DKIM is entered.</p>
<p>The record is set in TYPE: TXT</p>
<p>Host is @ or sub-domain with prefix (it is provided by Sender Server to differentiate DKIM from different senders, Google uses google or custom prefix set by user)</p>
<pre>Value: v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=a_key_identifier</pre>
<p>Here DKIM1 in v is DKIM Protocol and k is type of key encryption used and p is key value which is different for every domain and given by the Sender, also this is public key and is its private key is used at senders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is DMARC?</h2>
<p>DMARC, which stands for “Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance”, is an email authentication, policy, and reporting protocol. It builds on the widely deployed <a href="/posts/knowing-spf-records-and-setting-them-up-correctly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPF</a> and DKIM protocols, adding linkage to the author (“From:”) domain name, published policies for recipient handling of authentication failures, and reporting from receivers to senders, to improve and monitor protection of the domain from fraudulent email.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1lQGFCpRuU"><p><a href="https://static.hashhackers.com/posts/knowing-spf-records-and-setting-them-up-correctly/">Knowing SPF Records and Setting Them Up Correctly</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe title="&#8220;Knowing SPF Records and Setting Them Up Correctly&#8221; &#8212; Hash Hackers" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" src="https://static.hashhackers.com/posts/knowing-spf-records-and-setting-them-up-correctly/embed/#?secret=1lQGFCpRuU" data-secret="1lQGFCpRuU" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<h2>Before you start</h2>
<p>Before you set up DMARC, we recommend you set up <a href="/posts/knowing-spf-records-and-setting-them-up-correctly/">Sender Policy Framework (SPF)</a> and <a href="/posts/knowing-dkim-records-and-setting-them-up-correctly/">Domain Keys Identified Mail</a> (DKIM). DMARC uses SPF and DKIM to verify that messages are authentic. Messages that do not pass SPF or DKIM trigger your DMARC policy.</p>
<h2>DMARC with third-party email providers</h2>
<p>For DMARC to effectively manage suspicious messages, messages should be sent from your own domain. Messages sent from third-party email providers for your organization can appear invalid and be rejected, depending on the DMARC policy.</p>
<p>To prevent messages from third-party email providers from being marked invalid:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share your DKIM key with the mail provider so they can add the key to outgoing messages.</li>
<li>Ask the mail provider to send messages through your network.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setup a DMARC Record in DNS</h2>
<p>For this i assume you already have <a href="/posts/knowing-spf-records-and-setting-them-up-correctly/">SPF</a> and <a href="/posts/knowing-dkim-records-and-setting-them-up-correctly/">DKIM</a> Records. You can add DMARC Record and setup it in 3 ways.</p>
<ul class="spaced-list">
<li>Replace the example domain in these steps with your domain.</li>
<li>Replace the example values with values for your own DMARC policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add a DNS record at <strong>_dmarc</strong></p>
<p><strong>TXT record name: </strong>In the first field, under DNS Host name, enter:</p>
<p><code>_dmarc.example.com</code></p>
<p><strong>TXT record value:</strong> In the second field, enter the values that define your DMARC policy, for example:</p>
<p><code>v=DMARC1; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com; p=quarantine; pct=90; sp=none</code></p>
<p>Here, v is for DMARC Protocol and is required, rua is to send DMARC Reports to your email address and is optional, p is how messages are handled and is required, pct is what Sets the percent of suspicious messages that the DMARC policy applies to, Suspicious messages are messages that fail the DMARC check and this is optional, sp is to set policy for sub domains if there is no different settings for them and its values can be same as values of p.</p>
<h4>DMARC TXT record values (Source: <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2466563" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a>)</h4>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Gmail does not support the DMARC <em>ruf</em> tag, used to send failure (forensic) reports.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Sender Policy Framework (<b>SPF</b>) record is a type of Domain Name Service (DNS) TXT record that identifies which mail servers are permitted to send email on behalf of your domain. The purpose of an <b>SPF</b> record is to detect and prevent spammers from sending messages with forged From addresses on your domain.</p>
<h2>Why SPF Records?</h2>
<p>SPF Records are value for sender&#8217;s domain which are allowed to send email on behalf of your domain name. These value differ from operator to operator. If you are using Google Email then your SPF Record looks like <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/33786?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all</a> and for Amazon SES it looks like <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/spf.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all</a> and so on.</p>
<h2>How to Find Correct SPF Records?</h2>
<p>SPF Records for popular services like sendgrid and amazon ses remains same, you can find by searching them on google. terms will be SPF RECORDS SENDGRID and SPF RECORDS AMAZON SES.</p>
<h2>Way to Create Single SPF Record</h2>
<pre>Host: @ or Sub-domain</pre>
<pre>Type: TXT Record</pre>
<pre>TTL: 3200 or Default</pre>
<pre>Value: v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all</pre>
<h2>Way to Create SPF Record for Multiple Senders</h2>
<pre>Host: @ or Sub-domain</pre>
<pre>Type: TXT Record</pre>
<pre>TTL: 3200 or Default</pre>
<pre>Value: v=spf1 include:amazonses.com include:_spf.google.com ~all</pre>

<h2>Checking Records for Errors</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s more popular place to check directly at Google. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h3 id="how-to-create-the-instance-required-for-this-software">How to Create the instance required for this software?</h3>
<p>According to me only. (WORKS PERFECTLY) You can try other ways too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a account at Google Cloud Console if you don’t have one.</li>
<li>Go to GoogleCloud</li>
<li>Create Instance.</li>
<li>Select Core and RAM limits as your requirement.</li>
<li>In Boot Disk option select Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Trusty.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite services is Let’s Encrypt. They issue free SSL certificates. I have written about how to generate a certificate for a Web Service using their service. They have just started issuing wildcard certificates, and in this blog post I will show you how to make one for an Azure App Service Environment (ASE).</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-wild-card-ssl-certificate">What is a Wild Card SSL Certificate?</h3>
<p>In computer networking, a <strong>wildcard certificate</strong> is a public key certificate which can be used with multiple subdomains of a domain. In easy words, it secures every sub-domain of your domain eg. a wildcard will secure anyname.domain.org documents.domain.org <a href="http://www.domain.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.domain.org</a> as well as domain.org.</p>
<h4 id="requirements">Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>You need a Domain Name to Get a Certificate, Lets Encrypt Certificates are not for IP Addresses.</li>
<li>Need to access DNS Panel of your Domain.</li>
<li>Just a little bit of time.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h4>
<p><code>Note: If you are a developer and want to issue a Wildcard Certificate using command lines visit Documentation of Let’s Encrypt.</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Open SSL For Free.</li>
<li>Creating a Account is Recommend. (Easy Renewals)</li>
<li>In the blank option enter your domain name like this:
<pre><code>*.hashhackers.com hashhackers.com www.hashhackers.com
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Correction <code>Please enter three varients to avoid problems in future as given above.</code></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><code>Disposable email addressing</code> (DEA) refers to an approach where a unique email address is used for every contact or entity. The benefit is that if anyone compromises the address or utilises it in connection with email abuse, the address owner can easily cancel (or “dispose” of) it without affecting any of their other contacts.</p>
<p>Such disposable addresses are generally provided by a service company (paid or free) that forwards mail from the DEA to the actual address, but email sub-addressing techniques can also be used to provide a subset of similar advantages.</p>
<p>Thought there may be a lot of solutions on the internet to make these sites at cost but here is a solution you would like to use.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.hashhackers.com/posts/idm/" rel="nofollow">https://static.hashhackers.com/posts/idm/</a></p>
<p>Demo: <a href="https://bhadoomail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bhadoo Mail</a> works on Synox Disposable Mail Software.</p>
<p>Open Source Software : <a href="https://github.com/synox/disposable-mailbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/synox/disposable-mailbox</a></p>
<p>While this Software runs on PHP v.7.2 and above, you can tweak some code to run on some lower versions too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the Software from here: <a href="https://github.com/synox/disposable-mailbox/archive/master.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download</a></li>
<li>Extract the ZIP Archive.</li>
<li>Now you need to upload the content of the “src” Folder to your Hosting where you want to run this software.</li>
<li>You’ll also need access to Catch All email account. Contact your hosting provider for more.</li>
<li>Now rename <code>config.sample.php</code> to <code>config.php</code> and move it to outside the <code>public_html</code> folder. One directory back i.e. not on the public access.</li>
<li>Now edit the <code>index.php</code> file.</li>
<li>change <code>require_once ‘../../config.php‘;</code> to <code>require_once ‘./../config.php‘;</code></li>
<li>If you have PHP version less than 7.2 then in 2nd line, change 7.2 to your PHP Version.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that lowering PHP version more than required may cause your app not to work.</li>
<li>Now edit <code>config.ph</code> file.</li>
<li>In IMAP url write down your mail host url given by your hosting company.</li>
<li>username and password of your Catch All Email Account.</li>
<li>Learn more about getting a Catch All Email Account Here.</li>
<li>in config domains, enter all domains you need to use for emails. It can be one or more.</li>
<li>Now open the Web URL where you uploaded your website.</li>
<li>If things are right you will see a page like given below.</li>
<li>If you are facing errors please post your query <a href="https://github.com/synox/disposable-mailbox/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
<li>A Free Youtube video will be available for this process shortly.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="how-amp-pages-are-cached">How AMP pages are cached</h2>
<p>In this document, you’ll learn about the role of the AMP Cache in the AMP ecosystem, and how your AMP page gets cached.</p>
<p>##What is an AMP Cache?</p>
<p>An AMP Cache is a proxy-based content delivery network (CDN) for delivering valid AMP documents. AMP Caches are designed to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Serve only valid AMP pages.</li>
<li>Allow AMP pages to be preloaded efficiently and safely.</li>
<li>Perform additional user-beneficial performance optimizations to content.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-does-my-amp-page-get-cached">How does my AMP page get cached?</h3>
<p>By using the AMP format, you are making your content available to be cached by AMP Caches. There are a few ways that your AMP page can end up in an AMP Cache:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Platform discovery</code>: Platforms discover your AMP content via the <code>&lt;html &#x26a1;&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;html amp&gt;</code> tag and cache the content. For example, Google Search crawls content; for any identified and valid AMP pages, the content is added to the Google AMP Cache.</li>
<li><code>Cache URL request</code>: Platforms can specifically request an AMP page by using the AMP Cache URL format. The AMP Cache acts as a reverse proxy, therefore, when the platform accesses the page, it results in the page being cached automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://static.hashhackers.com/posts/download-wordpress-premium-yoast-seo-plugin/" rel="nofollow">https://static.hashhackers.com/posts/download-wordpress-premium-yoast-seo-plugin/</a></p>
<p>Cloudflare AMP Cache URL example:</p>
<p><code><a href="https://amp.cloudflare.com/c" rel="nofollow">https://amp.cloudflare.com/c</a> /foo.com/amp_document.html</code></p>
<p>Google AMP Cache URL example:</p>
<p><code><a href="https://foo-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c" rel="nofollow">https://foo-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c</a> /s/foo.com/amp_document.html</code></p>
<p><code>Note</code>: The AMP Cache URL is not a user-facing URL, that is, users wouldn’t typically request content via those URLs.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-you-use-it-to-reduce-your-hosting-loads">How can you use it to reduce your Hosting Loads?</h3>
<p>The answer is easy by sharing AMP CDN URLs, Because the data is loaded from google servers instead from you hosting server, it reduces immediate impact on your website resources.</p>
<p>Given below is a Google CDN URL Generator tool or you can also visit <a title="https://amp-cdn-link-generator.hashhackers.com" href="https://amp-cdn-link-generator.hashhackers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://amp-cdn-link-generator.hashhackers.com</a></p>
<p>Just enter your AMP URL and click on Convert Button. You can then right click on the URL and Copy, Share.</p>
