										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The only way to succeed in the world of blogging and to promote your brand or business is to know some of the best ways to do it. If you have been thinking of starting a website, then it must be your one of the most top priority to buy a top-level domain.</p>
<p>So today I will be providing you the complete list of <strong>best domain registrar</strong> which I would recommend you purchase a domain name. But before this, you should know why and which are the qualities you should look before you buy a domain name.</p>
<p>Choosing a domain name is a daunting task. As many questions arise like which Domain registrar should you should choose? Also, which one provides the best services, price, and support? But don’t worry this is the right place for you and we will guide you in this regard that is We will provide a complete list of the best domain registrar to buy a cheap domain.</p>
<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<h3><strong>How I Go About Ranking These Top Domain Name Registrars</strong></h3>
<p>There’s a number of criteria I go by in order to rank the best domain name registrars on the market. Like I’ve said earlier in this guide, I have used and still use all of these domain registrars, so personal experience goes a long way with my rankings.</p>
<p>That being said, I also consider the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of which to search for domain names</li>
<li>Simple, no-hassle checkout process</li>
<li>Easy configuration</li>
<li>Intuitive dashboard for users to manage their domains</li>
<li>User-friendly DNS settings</li>
<li>Excellent customer service on both live support, knowledge center, and phone.</li>
<li>Number of upsells in the buying process</li>
<li>Long history and a good reputation</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<h2><strong>Best Domain Registrar </strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1) <a title="NameCheap Best Domain Registrar" href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a></strong></h3>
<p><a title="Namecheap " href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap.com</a> is one of the most popular domain registrars to buy a cheap domain name. With .com domain name for only $10 per year and .net &amp; .org for $11-$12 per year.</p>
<p>They are a decently cheap priced domain registrar. But the only additional fee that they add to their service is an additional 18¢ for <strong>ICANN registration/year</strong>.</p>
<p><a title="Namecheap" href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> is famous for their Twitter and Facebook contest, where they offer domain names for the lowest price for a particular time. I would recommend buying a domain name from Namecheap.com.</p>
<h3><strong>2)</strong><a title="GoDaddy" href="https://www.godaddy.com/domains" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong> GoDaddy</strong></a></h3>
<p>Godaddy is one of the best domain registrars that costs $10 for the first year and $15 for every year after that; that’s a lot of additional hidden prices.</p>
<p>They are still arguably the leaders of domain name registrars. So there’s no reason you shouldn’t be checking out what they have to offer.</p>
<h3>3) <strong><a title="Domain.com" href="https://www.domain.com/" rel="nofollow">Domain.com</a></strong></h3>
<p>With .com domain names starting from $10 per year, Domain.com is the decent domain name registration service. They are one of the popular choices for domain registration. .net and .org priced at $8.99/year.</p>
<p>So, Domain.com is one of the best value for money domain registrars. Domain.com has a lot to offer given its low price.</p>
<p>So choose anyone though I would recommend buying a domain name from Namecheap.com. But you could try others also.</p>
<h3><strong><a href="https://www.hover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4. Hover</a></strong></h3>
<p>Hover officially launched in 2009, but it’s an offshoot of Tucows Inc., which is the third-largest ICANN accredited registrar online. Hover is essentially a merger of three big players in the domain registrar space.</p>
<p>Hover is great in that they’re incredibly straightforward. They offer domain registering and that’s it. For that reason, it’s very easy to register a domain with them, because that’s all they do. You won’t be bombarded with endless upsells and advertisements for other services of theirs.</p>
<p>The process of setting up your domain names is also quite seamless and their backend is quite nice to use.</p>
<p>Since they just focus their service around this one thing there support is also excellent, and you’ll always have a real person handling your request.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/">5. <strong>Dreamhost</strong></a></h2>
<p>Dreamhost was founded way back in 1997. Today they’re a full-fledged hosting provider and domain name registrar. They now host over 1.5 million websites and have over 400,000 customers. If you’re looking for a domain name registrar that also offers hosting, then Dreamhost might be a good choice for you.</p>
<p>Dreamhost has a host of cool features, like, having a nearly unlimited supply of domain name extensions, offering free domain privacy, easy control over your domain’s settings, and as a plus they’re an environmentally friendly company.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they don’t offer a discount if you already have a domain name and you’re looking to transfer it over to them. They also have a very solid refund policy, but sadly it only transfers over to their shared hosting plans.</p>
<p>Dreamhost costs <strong>$13.95 per year to register a .com</strong> domain name, with the pricing of other domain name extensions being much lower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>DomainKeys Identified Mail</em> (<em>DKIM</em>) is an email authentication method designed to detect forged sender addresses in emails (email spoofing), a technique often used in phishing and email spam.</p>
<h2>What is DKIM?</h2>
<p>Its Email Authentication and the record proves that it was sent from the domain it is being shown. This uses Cryptographic Key to sign the emails.</p>
<h2>Why DKIM?</h2>
<p>In simple words, DKIM is necessary so that your messages doesn&#8217;t end up in user spam box, like why Google, Facebook messages never goes into spam and unless we send them ourselves, as they are verified and authenticated that Google or Facebook sent them.</p>
<h2>Setup DKIM Records</h2>
<p>You cannot setup DKIM Record own your own without any help because DKIM is key based and the key must be present on Outgoing Mail Server to match to your domain. GSuite has Authentication Tab in GMAIL Settings for DKIM Signing.</p>
<p>To setup a DKIM you must contact your Email Provider as many services like Godaddy Shared Hosting doesn&#8217;t even supports it. However it doesn&#8217;t means you messages will end up in spam because we can setup DMARC policy and which will help avoid spams.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="huLUZXnqZB"><p><a href="https://static.hashhackers.com/posts/knowing-dmarc-records-and-setting-them-up-correctly/">Knowing DMARC Records and Setting Them Up Correctly</a></p></blockquote>

<p>For every sub-domain or domain a separate DKIM key is required and also a seperate DKIM Record. When you setup emails with clients like Amazon SES and SendGrid they provide you these CNAME Records or DKIM Records to setup DKIM. CNAME records can be used to point a domain to another domain or sub-domain where your DKIM is entered.</p>
<p>The record is set in TYPE: TXT</p>
<p>Host is @ or sub-domain with prefix (it is provided by Sender Server to differentiate DKIM from different senders, Google uses google or custom prefix set by user)</p>
<pre>Value: v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=a_key_identifier</pre>
<p>Here DKIM1 in v is DKIM Protocol and k is type of key encryption used and p is key value which is different for every domain and given by the Sender, also this is public key and is its private key is used at senders.</p>
<p>Check for errors using <a href="https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/checkmx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MXChecker from Google</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is DMARC?</h2>
<p>DMARC, which stands for “Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance”, is an email authentication, policy, and reporting protocol. It builds on the widely deployed <a href="/posts/knowing-spf-records-and-setting-them-up-correctly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPF</a> and DKIM protocols, adding linkage to the author (“From:”) domain name, published policies for recipient handling of authentication failures, and reporting from receivers to senders, to improve and monitor protection of the domain from fraudulent email.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1lQGFCpRuU"><p><a href="https://static.hashhackers.com/posts/knowing-spf-records-and-setting-them-up-correctly/">Knowing SPF Records and Setting Them Up Correctly</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe title="&#8220;Knowing SPF Records and Setting Them Up Correctly&#8221; &#8212; Hash Hackers" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" src="https://static.hashhackers.com/posts/knowing-spf-records-and-setting-them-up-correctly/embed/#?secret=1lQGFCpRuU" data-secret="1lQGFCpRuU" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<h2>Before you start</h2>
<p>Before you set up DMARC, we recommend you set up <a href="/posts/knowing-spf-records-and-setting-them-up-correctly/">Sender Policy Framework (SPF)</a> and <a href="/posts/knowing-dkim-records-and-setting-them-up-correctly/">Domain Keys Identified Mail</a> (DKIM). DMARC uses SPF and DKIM to verify that messages are authentic. Messages that do not pass SPF or DKIM trigger your DMARC policy.</p>
<h2>DMARC with third-party email providers</h2>
<p>For DMARC to effectively manage suspicious messages, messages should be sent from your own domain. Messages sent from third-party email providers for your organization can appear invalid and be rejected, depending on the DMARC policy.</p>
<p>To prevent messages from third-party email providers from being marked invalid:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share your DKIM key with the mail provider so they can add the key to outgoing messages.</li>
<li>Ask the mail provider to send messages through your network.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setup a DMARC Record in DNS</h2>
<p>For this i assume you already have <a href="/posts/knowing-spf-records-and-setting-them-up-correctly/">SPF</a> and <a href="/posts/knowing-dkim-records-and-setting-them-up-correctly/">DKIM</a> Records. You can add DMARC Record and setup it in 3 ways.</p>
<ul class="spaced-list">
<li>Replace the example domain in these steps with your domain.</li>
<li>Replace the example values with values for your own DMARC policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add a DNS record at <strong>_dmarc</strong></p>
<p><strong>TXT record name: </strong>In the first field, under DNS Host name, enter:</p>
<p><code>_dmarc.example.com</code></p>
<p><strong>TXT record value:</strong> In the second field, enter the values that define your DMARC policy, for example:</p>
<p><code>v=DMARC1; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com; p=quarantine; pct=90; sp=none</code></p>
<p>Here, v is for DMARC Protocol and is required, rua is to send DMARC Reports to your email address and is optional, p is how messages are handled and is required, pct is what Sets the percent of suspicious messages that the DMARC policy applies to, Suspicious messages are messages that fail the DMARC check and this is optional, sp is to set policy for sub domains if there is no different settings for them and its values can be same as values of p.</p>
<h4>DMARC TXT record values (Source: <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2466563" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a>)</h4>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Gmail does not support the DMARC <em>ruf</em> tag, used to send failure (forensic) reports.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Sender Policy Framework (<b>SPF</b>) record is a type of Domain Name Service (DNS) TXT record that identifies which mail servers are permitted to send email on behalf of your domain. The purpose of an <b>SPF</b> record is to detect and prevent spammers from sending messages with forged From addresses on your domain.</p>
<h2>Why SPF Records?</h2>
<p>SPF Records are value for sender&#8217;s domain which are allowed to send email on behalf of your domain name. These value differ from operator to operator. If you are using Google Email then your SPF Record looks like <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/33786?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all</a> and for Amazon SES it looks like <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/spf.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all</a> and so on.</p>
<h2>How to Find Correct SPF Records?</h2>
<p>SPF Records for popular services like sendgrid and amazon ses remains same, you can find by searching them on google. terms will be SPF RECORDS SENDGRID and SPF RECORDS AMAZON SES.</p>
<h2>Way to Create Single SPF Record</h2>
<pre>Host: @ or Sub-domain</pre>
<pre>Type: TXT Record</pre>
<pre>TTL: 3200 or Default</pre>
<pre>Value: v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all</pre>
<h2>Way to Create SPF Record for Multiple Senders</h2>
<pre>Host: @ or Sub-domain</pre>
<pre>Type: TXT Record</pre>
<pre>TTL: 3200 or Default</pre>

<ul>
<li>You can verify domain using three methods Meta Tag, HTML File Upload or DNS (Use any one).</li>
<li>To verify using Meta Tag copy the given code and paste it on homepage of your domain before head element as shown below and click verify.</li>
<li>To verify using HTML File Upload download the file by choosing from the option at Admin Site and upload the file at root of your domain. The method is complex and first time users always gets problems.</li>
<li>To verify using DNS method (Best, Easy and Recommended) because we’ll need to use DNS to add more records later. Follow below instructions.</li>
<li>Login to your DNS Provider, where your domain is purchased or if you’ve changed Name Servers at the appropriate location. Most of the times Google shows where your domain is hosted.</li>
<li>We are using Cloudflare here so after selecting DNS Settings at CLoudflare we’ll add a TXT record.</li>
<li>Select the DNS type to TXT Record.</li>
<li>There are two values for addition, one is Host and other one is Value, If you are using subdomain then you need to enter the subdomains suffix i.e for testmail.example.com use testmail and for example.com use @ sign. replace example.com with your domain.</li>
<li>now copy the value from Google Admin Page and paste it into the Value Bar and Click on Ok or Save Button.</li>

<p><code>Note: You need a International Debit/Credit card or Paypal account to Purchase domains from Network Solutions.</code></p>
<h4 id="what-are-domain-names">What are Domain Names</h4>
<p>A <code>domain name</code> is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet. In 2017, 330.6 million domain names had been registered.</p>
<p>Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains) of the DNS root domain, which is nameless. The first-level set of domain names are the top-level domains (TLDs), including the generic top-level domains (gTLDs), such as the prominent domains com, info, net, edu, and org, and the country code top-level domains (ccTLDs). Below these top-level domains in the DNS hierarchy are the second-level and third-level domain names that are typically open for reservation by end-users who wish to connect local area networks to the Internet, create other publicly accessible Internet resources or run web sites.</p>
